      <h2> About me and my work: </h2>
      <p class="about_me"> I am a PhD candidate at the Kapteyn Institute of the University of Groningen. I am currently working on neutron star (NS) low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). A LMXB is a system of two stellar objects orbiting around each other. One of them is a compact object, usually a NS or a black hole (BH), while the other is a star that has become so big that the gravity of the compact object can suck matter from the surface of the big star, a process that we call accretion. As the compact object accretes matter from the surface of the evolved star, it forms a disc around itself that we call accretion disk. My team and I are trying to understand the physical properties of neutron stars and their surrounding environment by modeling their extremely fast (~milli second) variability which is observed in the X-rays. In particular we study the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in NS and BH LMXBs. These QPOs are nothing more but variability in the X-ray luminosity of the source at ms timescales. </p>
